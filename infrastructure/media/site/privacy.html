        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: December 18, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Thanks for using Heart of Yours. This document explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what choices
            you have.</p>

        <p>We believe your workout data is your own. We store it carefully, don’t share it, and don’t lock it behind a
            paywall.</p>

        <p>If anything here feels off, you're welcome to stop using the app — but we hope you won’t have to.</p>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>To create an account, you’ll need to provide an email address. That’s it. Names are optional.</p>
        <p>You can sign in using your email, or a supported third-party login (like Sign in with Apple). If you lose
            access to that method, we won’t be able to recover your account.</p>

        <h3>Workout Data</h3>
        <p>This is the core of the app: your sets, reps, weights, and sessions. It’s stored securely in the cloud and
            linked to your account. You can always view, update, or delete your data.</p>

        <h3>App Usage &amp; Debug Info</h3>
        <p>We collect basic analytics (like which screens are used) and crash logs to help improve the app. This data is
            anonymous and never sold.</p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>

        <h3>Exporting Data</h3>
        <p>Data export features are in development. In the meantime, you can request a copy of your data by emailing <a
                href="mailto:info@heart-of.me">info@heart-of.me</a>.</p>

        <h3>Deleting Your Account</h3>
        <p>You can delete your Heart of Yours account — and all your data — from inside the app. To do that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the app and go to <strong>Settings</strong> (tap on your username or the Gear icon)
            </li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Account Control</strong></li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Delete Account</strong></li>
            <li>Confirm deletion</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>If you signed in with Google or Apple, you’ll first need to set a password. This ensures you can securely
            confirm the deletion.</em></p>
        <p>Once confirmed, your account and all synced workout data will be permanently removed. Deleted means
            deleted.</p>

        <h2>Other Details</h2>

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>We store user data on secure servers operated by AWS. That may include servers located outside your
            country.</p>

        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>This app isn’t designed for children under 13, and we don’t knowingly collect data from them. If you believe
            a child has created an account, please contact us.</p>

        <h3>Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>This policy may evolve. If anything important changes, we’ll let you know.</p>

        <p>Simple as that. If you have questions, email <a href="mailto:info@heart-of.me">info@heart-of.me</a>.</p>
