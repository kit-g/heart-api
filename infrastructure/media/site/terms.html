        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: December 18, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>These Terms of Use (<strong>“Terms”</strong>) govern your use of the Heart of Yours mobile application and
            related services (the <strong>“App”</strong>, <strong>“Service”</strong>), operated by the developer of
            Heart of Yours (“we”, “us”, “our”).</p>

        <p>By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree with them, please don’t use the Service.</p>

        <h2>The Service</h2>
        <p>Heart of Yours is a workout tracking app. It helps you plan workouts, log exercises, track progress, and
            review your training history.</p>
        <p>We try to keep the app stable, useful, and respectful of your time. That said, the Service is provided as-is,
            and things may change or break from time to time.</p>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>To use certain features, you need to create an account. You agree to provide accurate and current information
            and to keep your login credentials secure.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for all activity under your account. If you believe your account has been compromised,
            please contact us as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that are used abusively, unlawfully, or in violation of
            these Terms.</p>

        <h2>Your Content</h2>
        <p>Anything you enter into the app — workouts, exercises, notes, measurements — is your content.</p>
        <p>You retain full ownership of your data. We only store and process it to provide the Service to you.</p>
        <p>By using the Service, you grant us permission to store, process, and display your content as needed for
            normal app operation. Nothing more.</p>

        <h2>Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Heart of Yours does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice.</p>
        <p>Any fitness or exercise activity carries inherent risk. You are responsible for deciding what is appropriate
            for your body and circumstances.</p>
        <p>If you have a medical condition, injury, or any doubts about exercising safely, consult a qualified medical
            professional before using the Service.</p>
        <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and accept these risks.</p>

        <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the Service at any time. We make no guarantees about
            availability, uptime, or future features.</p>
        <p>We’ll try to avoid surprises — but this is a living project, not a contract for perfection.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time.</p>
        <p>You can delete your account from within the app, which will remove your account and associated data.</p>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if these Terms are violated or if required for legal or
            security reasons.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
            arising from your use of the Service.</p>
        <p>This includes — but is not limited to — loss of data, loss of progress, missed workouts, or injuries related
            to exercise activities.</p>
        <p>You use the Service at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”.</p>
        <p>We make no warranties — express or implied — regarding reliability, accuracy, or fitness for a particular
            purpose.</p>
        <p>We don’t promise the app will be bug-free, uninterrupted, or exactly what you expect it to be.</p>

        <h2>Links to Third Parties</h2>
        <p>The App may contain links to third-party services or platforms. We don’t control those services and aren’t
            responsible for their content or policies.</p>
        <p>Please review their terms and privacy policies separately.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service operator is based, without
            regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are significant, we’ll try to give reasonable
            notice.</p>
        <p>Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these Terms, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:info@heart-of.me">info@heart-of.me</a>.
